/**
 * AsyncLocker is used to prevent more than one instance of ngcc executing at the same time,
 * when being called in an asynchronous context.
 *
 * * When ngcc starts executing, it creates a file in the `compiler-cli/ngcc` folder.
 * * If it finds one is already there then it pauses and waits for the file to be removed by the
 *   other process. If the file is not removed within a set timeout period given by
 *   `retryDelay*retryAttempts` an error is thrown with a suitable error message.
 * * If the process locking the file changes, then we restart the timeout.
 * * When ngcc completes executing, it removes the file so that future ngcc executions can start.
