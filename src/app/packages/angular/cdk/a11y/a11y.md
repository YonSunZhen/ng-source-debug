The `a11y` package provides a number of tools to improve accessibility, described below.

## ListKeyManager
`ListKeyManager` manages the active option in a list of items based on keyboard interaction.
Intended to be used with components that correspond to a `role="menu"` or `role="listbox"` pattern.

### Basic usage
Any component that uses a `ListKeyManager` will generally do three things:
* Create a `@ViewChildren` query for the options being managed.
* Initialize the `ListKeyManager`, passing in the options.
* Forward keyboard events from the managed component to the `ListKeyManager`.

Each option should implement the `ListKeyManagerOption` interface:
```ts
interface ListKeyManagerOption {
  disabled?: boolean;
  getLabel?(): string;
}
```

### Wrapping
Navigation through options can be made to wrap via the `withWrap` method
```ts
this.keyManager = new FocusKeyManager(...).withWrap();
```

### Types of key managers
There are two varieties of `ListKeyManager`, `FocusKeyManager` and `ActiveDescendantKeyManager`.

#### FocusKeyManager
Used when options will directly receive browser focus. Each item managed must implement the
`FocusableOption` interface:
```ts
interface FocusableOption extends ListKeyManagerOption {
  focus(): void;
}
```

#### ActiveDescendantKeyManager
Used when options will be marked as active via `aria-activedescendant`.
Each item managed must implement the
`Highlightable` interface:
```ts
interface Highlightable extends ListKeyManagerOption {
  setActiveStyles(): void;
  setInactiveStyles(): void;
}
```

Each item must also have an ID bound to the listbox's or menu's `aria-activedescendant`.


## FocusTrap
The `cdkTrapFocus` directive traps <kbd>Tab</kbd> key focus within an element. This is intended to
be used to create accessible experience for components like
[modal dialogs](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#dialog_modal), where focus must be
constrained.

This directive is declared in `A11yModule`.

### Example
```html
<div class="my-inner-dialog-content" cdkTrapFocus>
  <!-- Tab and Shift + Tab will not leave this element. -->
</div>
```

This directive will not prevent focus from moving out of the trapped region due to mouse
interaction.

### Regions
Regions can be declared explicitly with an initial focus element by using
the `cdkFocusRegionStart`, `cdkFocusRegionEnd` and `cdkFocusInitial` DOM attributes.
`cdkFocusInitial` specifies the element that will receive focus upon initialization of the region.
`cdkFocusRegionStart` and `cdkFocusRegionEnd` define the region within which focus will be
trapped. When using the tab key, focus will move through this region and wrap around on either end.

For example:

```html
<a mat-list-item routerLink cdkFocusRegionStart>Focus region start</a>
<a mat-list-item routerLink>Link</a>
<a mat-list-item routerLink cdkFocusInitial>Initially focused</a>
<a mat-list-item routerLink cdkFocusRegionEnd>Focus region end</a>
```


## InteractivityChecker
`InteractivityChecker` is used to check the interactivity of an element, capturing disabled,
visible, tabbable, and focusable states for accessibility purposes. See the API docs for more
details.


## LiveAnnouncer
`LiveAnnouncer` is used to announce messages for screen-reader users using an `aria-live` region.
See [the W3C's WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-live)
for more information on aria-live regions.

### Example
```ts
@Component({...})
export class MyComponent {

 constructor(liveAnnouncer: LiveAnnouncer) {
   liveAnnouncer.announce("Hey Google");
 }
}
```

## FocusMonitor
The `FocusMonitor` is an injectable service that can be used to listen for changes in the focus
state of an element. It's more powerful than just listening for `focus` or `blur` events because it
tells you how the element was focused (via mouse, keyboard, touch, or programmatically). It also
allows listening for focus on descendant elements if desired.

To listen for focus changes on an element, use the `monitor` method which takes an element to
monitor and an optional boolean flag `checkChildren`. Passing true for `checkChildren` will tell the
`FocusMonitor` to consider the element focused if any of its descendants are focused. This option
defaults to `false` if not specified. The `monitor` method will return an Observable that emits the
`FocusOrigin` whenever the focus state changes. The `FocusOrigin` will be one of the following:

* `'mouse'` indicates the element was focused with the mouse
* `'keyboard'` indicates the element was focused with the keyboard
* `'touch'` indicates the element was focused by touching on a touchscreen
* `'program'` indicates the element was focused programmatically
* `null` indicates the element was blurred

In addition to emitting on the observable, the `FocusMonitor` will automatically apply CSS classes
to the element when focused. It will add `.cdk-focused` if the element is focused and will further
add `.cdk-${origin}-focused` (with `${origin}` being `mouse`, `keyboard`, `touch`, or `program`) to
indicate how the element was focused.

Note: currently the `FocusMonitor` emits on the observable _outside_ of the Angular zone. Therefore
if you `markForCheck` in the subscription you must put yourself back in the Angular zone.

```ts
focusMonitor.monitor(el).subscribe(origin => this.ngZone.run(() => /* ... */ ));
```

Any element that is monitored by calling `monitor` should eventually be unmonitored by calling
`stopMonitoring` with the same element.

<!-- example(focus-monitor-overview) -->

It is possible to falsify the `FocusOrigin` when setting the focus programmatically by using the
`focusVia` method of `FocusMonitor`. This method accepts an element to focus and the `FocusOrigin`
to use. If the element being focused is currently being monitored by the `FocusMonitor` it will
report the `FocusOrigin` that was passed in. If the element is not currently being monitored it will
just be focused like normal.

<!-- example(focus-monitor-focus-via) -->

### cdkMonitorElementFocus and cdkMonitorSubtreeFocus
For convenience, the CDK also provides two directives that allow for easily monitoring an element.
`cdkMonitorElementFocus` is the equivalent of calling `monitor` on the host element with
`checkChildren` set to `false`. `cdkMonitorSubtreeFocus` is the equivalent of calling `monitor` on
the host element with `checkChildren` set to `true`. Each of these directives has an `@Output()`
`cdkFocusChange` that will emit the new `FocusOrigin` whenever it changes.

<!-- example(focus-monitor-directives) -->

## Styling utilities
The CDK `a11y` package comes with a set of CSS styles that can be used when building accessible
components. To take advantage of them, you have to include the styles in your global stylesheet.
If you're using Material together with the CDK, these styles have been included for you already.

```scss
@import '~@angular/cdk/text-field/text-field';

@include cdk-a11y();
```

### Hiding elements, while keeping them available for screen readers
By default, screen readers and other assistive technology will skip elements that have
`display: none`, `visibility: hidden` etc. In some cases you may need to visually hide an element,
while keeping it available for assistive technology. You can do so using the `cdk-visually-hidden`
class:

```html
<div class="custom-checkbox">
  <input type="checkbox" class="cdk-visually-hidden">
</div>
```

### Targeting high contrast users
The `a11y` package offers a mixin that allows you to target users that have the Windows high
contrast mode turned on, via a media query. To target high contrast users, you can wrap your
styles with the `cdk-high-contrast` mixin:

```scss
button {
  @include cdk-high-contrast {
    outline: solid 1px;
  }
}
```
